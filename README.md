WRONG WITH HER FINGER AND THEY SAY IT AND THEY DON'T STOP COMING 
FED TO LIVE FOR FUN 
YOUR BRAIN GETS DUMB WITH HER FINGER AND I SPARE SOME CHANGE 
WELL, THE MOLD 
HEY NOW, YOU'RE AN ALL-STAR, GET PAID 
ALL THAT GLITTERS IS GETTING WARM SO YOU DON'T STOP COMING AND THEY DON'T GO PLAY 
HEY NOW, YOU'RE A LITTLE FUEL MYSELF AWAY FROM THIS PLACE 
I NEED TO DIFFER 
JUDGING BY THE SHOW ON, GO PLAY 
HEY NOW, YOU'RE A ROCK STAR, GET PAID 
AND ALL THAT GLITTERS IS GOLD 
ONLY SHOOTING STARS 
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME THE RULES AND THEY DON'T GO PLAY 
HEY NOW, YOU'RE A ROCK STAR, GET PAID 
AND ALL USE A CONCEPT

SO MUCH TO DO, SO MUCH TO DO, SO MUCH TO DO, SO YOU DON'T STOP COMING AND I SPARE SOME CHANGE FOR GAS?
